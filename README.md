Modulus is a work-in-progress modular tool mod which tries to not replace vanilla tool systems & integrate with mods wherever possible. All tool manipulation is done **within the inventory**, where you break up your tool into parts and can freely change each part of the tool! 

To edit a tool, right it with a *tool hammer* in your inventory. This will convert it into a modular tool and put it in edit mode. In edit mode, a box will show around your tool. You can take items out of it like a bundle! Once you're done, hit the tool with the hammer again and it will be usable!

## Features
- Swap out parts of your tool to create combinations like an axe-hoe
- Customize the rod of your tool, changing it's wood type

## Upcoming features
- Paint your tool with coatings made from rare vanilla resources to enhance it with unique powers!
- Tag your tool with a ribbon of any dye color (maybe including pride flags in the future)
- Repair your tool easier & reset your tool when it becomes too expensive!
- Automatic mod support with registry analysis & palette swapping
- Save your tool from the brink of death 
- New items and ways to make bows easier to use & more fun for survival play
- New weapons & weird tools!

Like it's tools, |modulus| also aims to be modular. All features will be configurable on Quilt and new weapons will be contained within a separate mod for those who want those weapons without tool modularity!
